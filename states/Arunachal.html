            <p class="p-text">Northwestern parts of this area came under the control of the Monpa kingdom of Monyul,
                which flourished between 500 BCE and 600 CE. The Monpa and Sherdukpen keep historical records of the
                existence of local
                chiefdoms in the northwest as well. The remaining parts of the state, especially the foothills and the
                plains, were under the control of the Chutia kings of Assam.

                Recent excavations of ruins of Hindu temples, such as the 14th-century Malinithan at the foot of the
                Siang hills in West Siang, indicate they were built during the chutia reign.
                The third heritage site, the 400-year-old Tawang Monastery in the extreme north-west of the state,
                provides some
                historical evidence of the Buddhist tribal people. The sixthDalai Lama was born in Tawang</p>
