                The hills at the height of 1,500 to 2,000 feet (460–615 m) were popular habitats probably due to
                availability of exposed dolerite basalt, useful for tool-making.</p>

            <h2 class="special">Speciality</h2>
            <p class="p-text">Assam is known for Assam tea and Assam silk. The state was the first site for oil drilling
                in Asia. Assam is home to the one-horned Indian rhinoceros, along with the wild water buffalo, pygmy
                hog, tiger and various species of Asiatic birds, and provides one of the last wild habitats for the
                Asian elephant.
