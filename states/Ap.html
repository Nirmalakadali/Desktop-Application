            <h2 class="history">History:</h2>
            <p class="p-text">A group of people named Andhras was mentioned in sanskrit texts such as Aitareya Brahmana
                (800–500 ). According to Aitareya Brahmana of the Rig Veda, the Andhras left north India from banks of
                River Yamuna and settled in south India. The Satavahanas have been mentioned by the names Andhra,
                Andhrara-jateeya and Andhrabhrtya in the Puranic literature. They did not refer themselves as Andhra in
                any of their coins or inscriptions; it is possible that they were termed as Andhras because of their
                ethnicity or because their territory included the Andhra region.</p>

            <h2 class="special">Speciality</h2>
            <p class="p-text">With religious and cultural significance as its identity, Andhra Pradesh is famous for
                rivers, such as Krishna and Gosthani, hills, such as Horsley and Papi, temples, the Kuchipudi dance form
                and production of Mica. Also known as the Rice Bowl of India, Andhra Pradesh is the biggest exporter of
                rice in India.

            </p>
            <h2 class="location">Location</h2>
            <p class="p-text">The state of Andhra Pradesh is located in the southeastern part of the Indian subcontinent and is bounded by the Indian states of Tamil Nadu to the south, Karnataka to the southwest and west, Telangana to the northwest and north, and Odisha to the northeast. Andhra Pradesh's eastern boundary is a 600-mile (970-km) coastline along the Bay of Bengal.</p>
