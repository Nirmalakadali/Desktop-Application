            <p class="p-text">In the Puranas, Uttarakhand was the ancient term for the central Indian Himalayas. Its
                peaks and valleys were known as Svarga loka: a temporary abode of the righteous, and the source of the
                Ganges. At that time, present-day Uttarakhand was also reportedly inhabited by rishis and sadhus.</p>

            <h2 class="special">Speciality</h2>
            <p class="p-text">Uttarakhand, a state in northern India crossed by the Himalayas, is known for its Hindu
                pilgrimage sites. Rishikesh, a major centre for yoga study, was made famous by the Beatles' 1968 visit.
                The city hosts the evening Ganga Aarti, a spiritual gathering on the sacred Ganges River.

            </p>
            <h2 class="location">Location</h2>
            <p class="p-text">The state is located in the northern part of India, bordered by the Indian state of
                Himachal Pradesh in north-west, by the Autonomous region of Tibet (China) in north-east, by Nepal in
                south-east, and by Uttar Pradesh (India) in south-west. Uttarakhand has a short border with Haryana in
                west.</p>
